# Running Routes for Out-of-Towners

Running Routes for Out-of-Towners is a web-based application designed to help runners visiting a new city find the perfect route based on their preferences for **distance**, **elevation**, and **points of interest (POIs)**. Whether youâ€™re looking to challenge yourself with elevation changes or simply enjoy scenic landmarks while staying active, this tool creates a route tailored just for you.

## Features

- **Custom Route Planning**: Generates running routes based on user-defined distance and preferences.

- **Elevation and POI Preferences**:
  - Elevation range selection.
  - Minimum POI requirement.
  - Priority factor selection (elevation vs POIs).

- **Google Places Integration**: 
  - Autocomplete for start and end locations.
  - Retrieve coordinates for selected locations.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Python**: Core backend language.
- **Flask**: Backend web framework.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM for querying nodes and edges.
- **PostgreSQL with PostGIS**: Spatial database for geospatial data.
- **NetworkX**: Graph library for pathfinding and graph operations.

### Frontend:
- **React**: Frontend framework.
- **Material-UI**: Stylish and responsive UI components.
- **Leaflet**: Map integration for route visualization.

## Project Construction Details

### Data Preparation
1. **Download OSM Data**: 
   - The project uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for British Columbia, downloaded from the [Geofabrik website](https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/canada/british-columbia.html).

2. **Construct Nodes and Edges**:
   - The raw OSM data was processed using [osm4routing](https://github.com/Tristramg/osm4routing), producing **nodes** and **edges** CSV files required for routing.

3. **Merge Elevation and POI Data**:
   - The `elevation.py` and `poi.py` scripts in the `data-migration` directory were used to merge elevation and POI data into the nodes data, which was then stored in a PostgreSQL database.

### Graph Creation and Routing
- After preparing the database, a graph was created using the `NetworkX` library in the `create_graph.py` script.
- The **BiDirectionalAStar** algorithm was implemented to find optimized routes based on user preferences for distance, elevation, and POIs.

### Backend and Frontend Data Flow
1. The backend (`app.py`) handles user preferences and processes the data:
   - Resolves starting and ending locations using Google Places API.
   - Identifies the closest nodes to these locations.
   - Uses the BiDirectionalAStar algorithm to calculate the valid routes.
2. The frontend (`App.js`) retrieves the route data from the backend and visualizes it on an interactive map.

## Project Structure

### Backend (`route-api/`):
- **`app.py`**: Flask application, routes, and Google API proxies.
- **`BiDirectionalAStar.py`**: Implementation of Bi-Directional A* algorithm to generate routes that meet the distance constraint.
- **`controller/`**: Database query functions for nodes and edges.
- **`database/db.py`**: SQLAlchemy database instance.
- **`model/models.py`**: SQLAlchemy models for nodes and edges.
- **`create_graph.py`**: Graph creation and caching logic using NetworkX.

### Frontend (`route-frontend/`):
- **`src/App.js`**: Main React application with interactive map and user inputs.
- **`src/components/`**: Components for user interaction and result visualization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js** and **npm**
- **Docker** (for database setup)
- **PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension** (if not using Docker)

### Steps to Run the Project

#### 1. Data Migration

1. Navigate to the `data-migration` directory.
   ```bash
   cd data-migration
   ```

2. Execute the following command to set up the database using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This command sets up a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS support and populates it with the processed OSM, elevation, and POI data.

#### 2. Start the Backend

1. Navigate to the `route-api` directory.
   ```bash
   cd route-api
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Flask backend server:
   ```bash
    python3 app.py
   ```


#### 3. Start the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `route-fronend` directory.
   ```bash
   cd route-fronend
   ```

2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### 3. Access the Application

1. Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
    http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. Input preferences and explore the generated routes.

## Usage

### Select Start and End Locations
- Input locations using the search boxes. Suggestions are powered by Google Places API.

- Select a location from the dropdown list.

### Set Preferences

- Enter the desired running distance (in kilometers).

- Specify an elevation range and a minimum number of POIs.

- Choose to prioritize elevation or POIs.

### Generate Route

- Click `Get Route` to calculate the optimal path.

- View route details such as total distance, elevation change and number of POIs along the path.

### Visualize Route

- View the calculated route on the map, including markers for POIs and route segments.
